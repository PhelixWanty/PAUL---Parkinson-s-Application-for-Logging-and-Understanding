# PAUL---Parkinson-s-Application-for-Logging-and-Understanding
An application for individuals with Parkinson's to help them keep better track of symptoms and medicine and see how this corelates with their quality of life.

This application will allow individuals to log the medicines they are taking with information such as the intervals to take the medicine, the dose, the indication of the medicine, and the side effects. They can also set reminders for their medications and track when they have taken a dose or missed a dose. 
Users can also log their symptoms and mood throughout the day and later see these displayed in a graphic to better understand how their medication intake correlates with their symptoms. 
Users can allow a Caregiver access to some of their logged information such as the medication they have taken or missed, and their symptoms. The user can also allow their caregiver access to change certain things such as their medication list, or push a reminder to them in regards to taking medication. 
In addition to this a user can allow a Clinician to be able to view their monthly medication intake report showing how many doses they have taken or missed or an overall report of their symptoms and medication intake to be used in managing the care of the user. 

PAUL is meant to give users a quicker, more managable option to keeping track of all their data as opposed to tracking it all on pen and paper. PAUL allows for easier reporting of their symptoms and adherence to their caregivers and clinicians and can give them insight on how their quality of life is affected by their medication adherence.
